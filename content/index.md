# The Gengo API

The Gengo API helps you to take your service global. Whether you're integrating an option for translation for your users, or building a fun translation application, our API handles a [variety of languages](/how-it-works/pricing-languages/) and [features](/api/).

The online documentation here describes the resources comprising the official Gengo API. You can jump right in by browsing the resources on the right >>

The current version of the Gengo API is v2. If you have any problems or requests please [contact support](mailto:support@gengo.com?subject=Gengo API Inquiry).

For older versions of the Gengo API, you can view [previous API documentation](/legacy/).

## Upcoming Changes

*2012-09-19*  
We are currently working on improved stability and better error messaging in response payloads. We have also recently changed how we manage the Gengo API documentation so we can make faster updates.
