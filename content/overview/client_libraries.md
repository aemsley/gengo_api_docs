# Client libraries

## Library selection

Weâ€™ve created libraries for major programming languages, ready to drop straight into your code. Pick yours from the selection below.

* <a href='https://github.com/myGengo/mygengo-csharp'>C#</a>
* <a href='https://github.com/myGengo/mygengo-java'>Java</a>
* <a href='https://github.com/myGengo/mygengo-php'>PHP</a>
* <a href='https://github.com/myGengo/mygengo-python'>Python</a>
* <a href='https://rubygems.org/gems/mygengo'>Ruby</a>

We recommend you still check out the <a href='/overview/getting_started/'>Getting Started</a>, <a href='/system_overview'>System Overview</a> and <a href='/callback_urls'>Callback URLs</a> pages so that you have a good overview of the API before you start building your app. And as always, please use the sandbox for testing.

Have a library that you want to see here? <a href='mailto:api@gengo.com?Subject=Client%20library%20request'>Let us know</a>.

All code is provided on an as-is basis under the <a href='https://raw.github.com/mygengo/mygengo-python/master/LICENSE.txt'>New BSD license</a>.
