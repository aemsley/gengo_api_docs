# Legacy API Documentation

The latest version of the Gengo API is v2. Documentation for previous versions (v1 and v1.1) is provided as a PDF download.

We encourage you to upgrade to v2, which adds support for asynchronous ordering - the ability to make simultaneous orders of large payloads - and file-based submissions.
